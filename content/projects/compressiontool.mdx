Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm used for lossless data compression. It was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952. The basic idea behind Huffman coding is to assign shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols. This results in a more efficient representation of the data, as commonly used symbols are represented with shorter codes, reducing the overall length of the encoded data.
